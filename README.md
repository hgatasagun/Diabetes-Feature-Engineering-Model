# Building a Diabetes Prediction Model through Data Analysis and Feature Engineering

![Açıklama](https://www.eczacidansaglik.com/haber/t_1632829586.jpg)

A machine learning model is requested to be developed that can predict whether individuals are diabetic or not when their features are provided. Before developing the model, it is expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps.

## Data Set Story
The dataset is a part of a large dataset maintained at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the USA. It is used for a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and above living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the state of Arizona. The target variable is defined as "outcome", where 1 indicates a positive diabetes test result and 0 indicates a negative result.

## Variables
- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
- Glucose: 2-hour plasma glucose concentration measured during an oral glucose tolerance test
- Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness
- Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function related to the diabetes history of relatives and the genetic relationship)
- BMI: Body mass index
- Age: Age in years
- Outcome: Presence (1) or absence (0) of the disease
